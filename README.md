    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 

    The client was Driverpass and they wanted a system that was able to schedule driver test and offer online resources. 

    What did you do particularly well? 

    The overall assumptions and limitations and the functionality of the system were clearly described in an easy-to-read presentation. 

    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

    I would improve the UML diagrams by making them easier to understand by cleaning them up and using the proper colors and shapes and by adding more what if cases to the use case diagram. 

    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

    After reviewing the interview transcript several times, I was able to list each individual concern that was expressed and then I was able to break them down into individual use case scenarios which was crucial in creating the needed charts to design this system as desired. 

    The users' needs were important to consider when designing this to make sure every one of their needs is met when the product is finished so that it functions correctly. 

    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 

    I approach software being heavily reliant on UML and process modeling to be able to generate an ideal design, and I would utilize Gannt chart to track a timeline of progress. I would also incorporate Agile methodologies to allow iterative design for quicker feedback cycles.
